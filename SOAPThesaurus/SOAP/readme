HTTPRequest.py  - includes support for SOAPpy
soap.py         - needed for SOAPpy

   drop both HTTPRequest.py and soap.py into lib/python/ZPublisher. Make a
   copy of your original HTTPRequest.py before dropping in this replacement.

setProperty     - just the function, not the entire file.

   edit lib/python/OFS/PropertyManager.py and replace the _setProperty function
   with this one.
