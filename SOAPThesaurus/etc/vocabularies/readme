The vocabulary file is expected to be in the following form:

  term TAB relation TAB term

That is to say, there are three fields separated by the TAB character.
Here's an example:

agricultural management	NT	crop management

You can read that line as saying "crop management" is a narrower
term of "agricultural management"

The relations supported are:


BT  - broader term
NT  - narrower term
RT  - related term
DF  - definition
SN  - scope note
UF  - use for
UFA - use for and type
USA - use and type
USE - use

the following relations are also supported:

CT  - category
CN  - contained within a category

The NAL Thesaurus also includes the idea of categories: all terms
are grouped into one of 17 top-level categories. If a term does not
have a broader term associated with it, but instead, has a category
immediately "above" it, then you'll see the category on the right
hand side of a CT relation:

  apiculture	CT	Insects and Entomology

"Insects and Entomology" is a category, "apiculture" is a term within
that category.

Conversely:

Insects and Entomology	CN	apiculture

which says "apiculture" is contained within the "Insects and Entomology"
category.
