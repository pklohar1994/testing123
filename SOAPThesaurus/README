Manifest:

copy_of_Thesaurus.zexp - import this file into your zope instance 
Thesaurus-Product      - the Zope Product -- move this directory to your Zope Products dir
etc                    - do a 'cp -r' of etc to someplace on your server where zope 
                         can find/read it

etc contains some subdirs and files:
     - config - holds the local hosts.allow file - this system does not read/use the
                system's hosts.allow file
                system's hosts.allow file
              - you'll also see a copy of the wsdl file here.
     - logs   - empty right now, but it'll hold webservices.log once you're running
     - schemas - empty, not used right now
     - vocabularies - where you'll put the vocabulary source file to be imported by the
                      thesaurus product.  look in vocabularies for a sample source file
                      and a 'readme' file describing the format.


there is a 'configure' file in the Thesaurus-Product directory you must edit to reflect
your installation.  In particular, make sure you edit:

  thePath: - make this reflect the absolute path to your the etc directory

  consoles: - a backdoor of sorts, guarantees admin access for the IPs listed here.
