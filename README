This directory contains data and software collected after the final
package of GEMET, WinCDS WebCDS and UpdateCDS was delivered by ETC/CDS
in the year 2001.

The final package 2001 is available as a CD-ROM image in the file
cdstools2001.iso. It has historical interest only! The data is not kept
up to date.

Older versions of GEMET have six groups under the ACCESSORY LISTS supergroup:
      ACTS
      FUNCTIONAL TERMS
      GENERAL TERMS
      PERSONNEL
      PROGRAMMES
      TIME (chronology)

According to Stefan Jensen; probably from the 1999/2000 to the 2000/2001
version at that time, the PERSONNEL, ACTS and PROGRAMMES groups were
taken out and the TIME was moved to another supergroup CNR/Stallbaumer
AT. All the terms under those groups, such as the Montreal Protocol were
taken out also.
