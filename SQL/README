These files are generated for the GimmeThesaurus product.

The upd_20_06_2007_new_groups.sql and upd_20_06_2007_new_terms.sql are actually
old terms taken out of GEMET around 2000. If we were to reintroduce them, the
connection to Themes would have to be taken from Info2001/GemAlph.pdf, and
the other translations from the Excel files.
